## Project Description 
üìñ
This project is a technical test for participating in the Hackathon & Marketplace (22/10/2024), organized by Barcelona Activa.
The app consists in generating random activities from https://bored-api.appbrewery.com/, with applied filter by category. As a Frontend developer, I was tasked with replicating the design provided in the brief. 

This project is built with React.js, Vite, TailwindCSS, HTML5, and CSS3.

Since bored-api.appbrewery.com has no origin response headers, I used CORS Anywhere (https://cors-anywhere.herokuapp.com) to avoid CORS policy issues (No 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin').

According to the given example, the app should be in Catalan, but all the responses I've received have been in English. I couldn't find any free translation APIs, so I decided to translate the text throughout the app according to the language of the fetched suggestions.
